# Lunar_xgboost_energy
XGBoost regression on local reaction energies
# User Guide
The folder contains 3 notebooks for the XGBoost regression and SHAP analysis:
1. xgboost_dE_H.ipynb: the H insertion energy;
2. xgboost_dE_H2O.ipynb: the H2O formation energy (recombinative desorption);
3. xgboost_dE_H2O_1.ipynb: the H2O formation energy;

The corresponding target energies and features are stores in 3d_H, 3d_H2O, and 3d_H2O_1, respectively.
